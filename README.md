# HR-Analytics---Attrition-Analysis

🚀 Excited to Share My HR Analytics Dashboard Built in Power BI! 🚀

In this project, I explored an HR Analytics Dataset to uncover attrition patterns and business insights that can help organizations reduce turnover and retain talent.

🎯 Objective:
To identify factors influencing employee attrition and provide data-driven insights to HR departments for improving retention strategies.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used:
✔️ Microsoft Power BI
✔️ DAX Formulas
✔️ Data Cleaning & Modeling
✔️ Data Visualization & Storytelling
✔️ HR Analytics Concepts

💡 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
✅ Employees aged 26-35 show the highest attrition rate, indicating a need for better career development programs.
✅ Male employees leave more often than females, suggesting deeper analysis into job satisfaction is required.
✅ Frequent business travelers exhibit higher turnover, possibly due to work-life imbalance.
✅ Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians experience more exits than other job roles.
✅ Departments like Sales and Research & Development need focused retention strategies.

🔎 What I Learned:
This project enhanced my ability to translate complex HR data into clear visual insights. I gained hands-on experience in designing interactive dashboards, creating KPIs, and implementing filters and slicers to allow dynamic storytelling.
